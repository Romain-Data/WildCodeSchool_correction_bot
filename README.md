# Correction Assistant

As part of my training at Wild Code School, I regularly have to correct my colleagues' exercises. This allows me to see other codes, other ways of solving the same problem. But it's also a time-consuming task. In theory, for every exercise I hand in, I have to correct 3.

**That's why I've tried to code a correction bot 🤖**.
